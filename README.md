# 📺 OTT Viewer Drop-off & Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Python to analyze streaming data and identify "churn points" where viewers stop watching content. By analyzing behavioral patterns, the project provides insights into audience retention strategies for OTT platforms.

## 🚀 Technical Workflow
* **Data Wrangling:** Processed viewership logs using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to handle missing metadata and timestamps.
* **Churn Identification:** Visualized viewership decay to find specific "episodes" or "minutes" where drop-off rates spike.
* [cite_start]**Trend Analysis:** Investigated if external factors like "Genre" or "Studio" (e.g., MAPPA, Toei Animation) impact how long a viewer stays engaged[cite: 134, 136].
* **Visual Storytelling:** Developed retention curves using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

## 📊 Results Summary
* Identified the "High-Risk" window for viewer drop-offs.
* [cite_start]Created a predictive view of audience stability based on content source material (Manga vs. Original)[cite: 52, 53, 55].
